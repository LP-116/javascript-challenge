## Task

This task involved using Javascript, HTML, CSS and D3.js to create a webpage that creates a table dynamically based upon the dataset provided. 
The webpage needs to allow users to filter the table data for specific values.

There were 2 parts to this challenge. 

# Part 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Part 1 involved creating a basic HTML web page and then using the dataset provided writing code the appends a table to the webpage and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Columns for the table are date/time, city, state, country, shape and comment.

A date form is used in the HTML document and the Javascript code is required to listen for events and search through the date/time columns to find rows that match the user input.

# Part 2: Automatic Table and Date Search
Part 2 adds multiple input tages to the equation so that the user can set multuple filters and search for UFO sightings.
The user can filter the dataset based on date/time, city, state, country, shape or a combination of any/all inputs.
